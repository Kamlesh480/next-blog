# Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

$env:Path += ";C:\nvm4w\nodejs"

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Key Learnings from the Next.js Project
**Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** <br>
Enables real-time updates to modules without requiring a full page reload. <br>
Improves development efficiency by retaining component states. <br><br>

**Component Creation in Next.js:** <br>
Components can be created in functional or class-based styles. <br>
Follow Next.js file-based routing by placing components in the /pages or /components directory. <br><br>

**Client Components:** <br>
Run in the browser and are suitable for interactive and dynamic content. <br>
Use the "use client" directive for specific rendering. <br><br>

**Rendering Techniques:** <br>
Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-renders pages at build time for performance. <br>
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Updates static pages on demand while maintaining SSG benefits. <br>
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Dynamically generates pages on each request for fresh data. <br><br>

**Routing:** <br>
Dynamic and nested routes using [slug].js or [[...slug]].js patterns. <br>
Group routes with folder structures for better organization. <br><br>

**Error Handling and Loading Strategies:** <br>
Use error.js and loading.js in the app directory for enhanced user experience. <br>
Implement global error boundaries and fallback loaders. <br><br>

**Authentication Setup:** <br>
Install authentication libraries (e.g., next-auth) and configure providers like Google or GitHub. <br>
Create client IDs and secrets, add them to the environment, and use sessions to verify user authentication. <br><br>

**Server Actions:** <br>
Utilize server-side functions to handle data operations securely. <br>
Simplifies interactions between the client and backend. <br><br>

**Sanity Studio Integration:** <br>
Configure Sanity Studio for managing and querying structured content. <br>
Define schemas for your data and use GROQ for queries. <br>
Fetch and display content dynamically within Next.js. <br><br>

**SEO and Head Management:** <br>
Use <Head> in Next.js for adding meta tags and managing SEO content dynamically. <br><br>

**React Features:** <br>
State Management: Leverage useState and useReducer for handling UI state. <br>
Server Actions State (new): Manage states effectively across server actions. <br><br>

**TypeScript & Zod Integration:** <br>
Use TypeScript for strict type checking. <br>
Integrate Zod for schema validation, particularly in form inputs and API responses. <br><br>

**Environment Setup:** <br>
Install next and its dependencies. <br>
Configure the project environment using .env for secure credential management. <br><br>


# Summary

Next.js offers server-side rendering strategies like SSG and ISR for efficient content rendering, enhancing app performance and user experience.

## Highlights
🚀 SSG vs. ISR: Understand static site generation and incremental static regeneration for optimized rendering. <br>
🎨 Hero Component Design: Create a visually appealing hero section using Tailwind CSS and reusable components. <br>
🗄️ Data Fetching: Fetch startup data with Gro query language and organize queries for easy access. <br>
⚡ PPR Implementation: Optimize the startup details page with partial page rendering for real-time updates. <br>
🔒 User Authentication: Set up author authentication and submission forms with validation for a seamless user experience. <br>
⏱️ Parallel Data Fetching: Implement parallel requests for faster loading times and better performance. <br>
🌐 Deployment: Successfully deploy the application to Vercel for public access. <br> <br>

## Key Insights
📈 Performance Optimization: Utilizing SSG and ISR can significantly improve loading times and user engagement by serving pre-rendered content. This strategy allows developers to strike a balance between static and dynamic content. <br>
🧩 Component Reusability: Using Tailwind CSS and Shaten components fosters a modular design approach, enabling developers to create a maintainable and scalable codebase. <br>
📊 Effective Data Management: Structuring queries in separate files promotes cleaner code and easier data retrieval, simplifying the development process and enhancing app functionality. <br>
🔄 Dynamic Updates: Implementing PPR allows for real-time data updates without compromising the user experience, making applications feel more responsive. <br>
🛠️ Form Validation: Incorporating validation libraries like Zod ensures robust user input handling, reducing errors and improving the reliability of the application. <br>
⚙️ Error Handling: Understanding and implementing error handling strategies is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience, especially in data-fetching scenarios. <br>
🌍 Real-World Application: The integration of advanced features like server actions and startup submissions illustrates Next.js’s capabilities in building modern web applications that meet user needs. <br>
