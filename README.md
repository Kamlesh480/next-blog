This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

$env:Path += ";C:\nvm4w\nodejs"

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Summary

Next.js offers server-side rendering strategies like SSG and ISR for efficient content rendering, enhancing app performance and user experience.

# Highlights
🚀 SSG vs. ISR: Understand static site generation and incremental static regeneration for optimized rendering.
🎨 Hero Component Design: Create a visually appealing hero section using Tailwind CSS and reusable components.
🗄️ Data Fetching: Fetch startup data with Gro query language and organize queries for easy access.
⚡ PPR Implementation: Optimize the startup details page with partial page rendering for real-time updates.
🔒 User Authentication: Set up author authentication and submission forms with validation for a seamless user experience.
⏱️ Parallel Data Fetching: Implement parallel requests for faster loading times and better performance.
🌐 Deployment: Successfully deploy the application to Vercel for public access.
# Key Insights
📈 Performance Optimization: Utilizing SSG and ISR can significantly improve loading times and user engagement by serving pre-rendered content. This strategy allows developers to strike a balance between static and dynamic content.
🧩 Component Reusability: Using Tailwind CSS and Shaten components fosters a modular design approach, enabling developers to create a maintainable and scalable codebase.
📊 Effective Data Management: Structuring queries in separate files promotes cleaner code and easier data retrieval, simplifying the development process and enhancing app functionality.
🔄 Dynamic Updates: Implementing PPR allows for real-time data updates without compromising the user experience, making applications feel more responsive.
🛠️ Form Validation: Incorporating validation libraries like Zod ensures robust user input handling, reducing errors and improving the reliability of the application.
⚙️ Error Handling: Understanding and implementing error handling strategies is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience, especially in data-fetching scenarios.
🌍 Real-World Application: The integration of advanced features like server actions and startup submissions illustrates Next.js’s capabilities in building modern web applications that meet user needs.
